# Register-Form-Project


This is a basic styled form that has 2 text inputs, 1 email input, 1 phone number input, and 2 passwords, one of which is for confirmation.
The form was created from HTML and CSS.
I hope you like it. ðŸ˜‰

PS: It is not yet connected to a server to process the data sent and does not have custom validations.
